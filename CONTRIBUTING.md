# Contributing Guidelines

## Getting Started
All translations are now submitted through our Weblate instance.

1. Make an account.
  - Go to https://weblate.colebob9.net/accounts/register/
  - Follow the instructions.
2. Log in at https://weblate.colebob9.net/accounts/login/
3. Translate!
  - Go to https://weblate.colebob9.net/#suggestions
  - Choose a component.
  - Click on the `Translate` button for the component.

## Scripts
- Each component represents a single scene from the game.
- Any kind of straight machine translation is NOT wanted or allowed. Only use it as a rough guide for translation. For the sake of the quality of the project, we only want those who are fluent in Japanese to be translating.
- Ignore any "Failing Checks" on Weblate. This is due to how the website is configured, and does not need to be followed.
- If you need context for what is happening in game, try to have the game open along side. You can also check the spreadsheet as well. (In #help-out on Discord)
- If you need any advice for translating, ask in #translation on our Discord server.
- If you are somewhat unsure of a translation, you can add it as a suggestion to come back to later.

## CGs
- CGs are currently not on Weblate. Please submit a PR for any changes.
- Translate CGs & textures by editing them and saving & commiting the translated version
  into the `cgs_translated` folder. 
- Try to not change the palette of images when editing. 
- Make sure to keep the alpha channel of textures (if there is one).
- Don't forget to file an issue to let people know you are translating a piece of content!
