## **Selamat Pagi!**
This is the main repository of the ongoing translation effort of
[*Nichijou: Uchuujin (2011)*](https://nichijou.fandom.com/wiki/Nichijou:_Uchuujin), a visual novel-style game based on the *Nichijou* manga and anime series. 

This repository is a continuation of the project as [the original repo](https://github.com/noneucat/uchuujin) was archived by the creator of the project. 

This repo only includes the in-game text. Please refer to other repos in [the organization](https://github.com/UchuujinTranslate) for code and other resources related to the project.

## **Downloading and playing the game**

We currently have very early versions of the game that you can test out for yourself! The English translation patches the original PSP game and you will need a copy of your own to play this.

**Please note that the game translation is currently in an extremely early state and is not fully playable.**

**If you are looking to simply play the game, it is best to wait for the full release.**



The early test patch files are currently on our Discord. Please go there for more information! https://discord.gg/UyT4S7F
